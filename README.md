# IITBBS Hackathon — Responsive Landing Page

This repository contains a responsive landing page created for the IITBBS hackathon. The goal was to implement a pixel-accurate, responsive web page using the provided design assets and to include meaningful enhancements where appropriate.

Contents

- `index.html` — main HTML file
- `assets/css/style.css` — styling and responsive rules
- `assets/js/script.js` — small interactive behaviors
- `assets/images/` — design assets (images, icons, patterns)

Key goals and evaluation criteria

- Design accuracy: follow the provided mockups and use supplied assets.
- Responsiveness: adapt layout across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Innovation: subtle animations, accessibility improvements, or minor interactive enhancements.
- Code quality: clean HTML structure, modular CSS, and light JavaScript.

Features implemented

- Responsive hero/slider section with background images and text overlays.
- Feature/service cards with icons and responsive grid layout.
- Events/testimonials section using provided images.
- Responsive navigation and mobile menu.
- Footer with contact/subscribe pattern and decorative assets.
- Small JavaScript enhancements (menu toggle, simple slider behavior) in `assets/js/script.js`.

Quick preview

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use "Open File" in the browser).

Run locally (recommended)

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

   git clone https://github.com/aditya8Raj/iitbbs-hackathon.git

2. Change into the project directory:

   cd iitbbs-hackathon

Development notes

- The project is intentionally lightweight: no build tools, bundlers, or frameworks are required. It's pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript so it works by opening `index.html` or serving statically.
- Styles live in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Keep images in `assets/images/`.
- JavaScript interactions are in `assets/js/script.js`.
